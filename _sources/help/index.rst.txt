Getting help
############

This page describes how to get in contact to solve problems you might
encounter when using Elemental.

Public chat
===========
The best place to quickly ask questions is via the public Gitter:

    :file: gitter.inc

Reporting issues
================
Elemental is still expanding in scope and there are unfortunately regular issues
in both the library itself and with the underlying toolchain (e.g.,
bugs have regularly been found in multiple compilers and MPI implementations).
The best place to document such problems is via creating a `GitHub Issue <https://github.com/elemental/Elemental/issues>`__.

Legacy mailing lists
====================
The following mailing lists used to be archived via
`gmane <http://gmane.org/about/>`__ at
`news.gmane.org <http://news.gmane.org/index.php?prefix=gmane.comp.mathematics.elemental>`__, but the link is unfortunately now broken due to the service
having been down for some time. This outage effected a large percentage of the
open source ecosystem. With that said, while the archiving is no longer
dependable, the mailing lists still function (and are still reasonably active).

Introduction

Overview
========
Elemental is a library for distributed-memory dense linear algebra that 
draws heavily from the `PLAPACK <http://cs.utexas.edu/users/plapack>`_ approach
of building a graph of matrix distributions with a simple interface for 
redistributions (much of the syntax of the library is also inspired from 
`FLAME <http://cs.utexas.edu/users/flame>`_). Elemental is also similar in 
functionality to `ScaLAPACK <http://netlib.org/scalapack>`_, which is the very 
widely used effort towards extending `LAPACK <http://netlib.org/lapack>`_ onto 
distributed-memory architectures.
Unlike PLAPACK and ScaLAPACK, Elemental performs virtually all computations using 
element-wise, rather than block, matrix distributions (please see the first
journal publication on Elemental, *Elemental: A new framework for distributed
memory dense matrix computations*, for a detailed discussion of this design 
choice).
Some of the unique features of Elemental include distributed implementations of:

* High-performance pseudospectral computation and visualization
* Quadratic-time low-rank Cholesky and LU modifications
* Bunch-Kaufman and Bunch-Parlett for accurate symmetric factorization
* LU and Cholesky with full pivoting
* Column-pivoted QR and interpolative/skeleton decompositions
* Quadratically Weighted Dynamic Halley iteration for the polar decomposition
* Spectral Divide and Conquer Schur decomposition and Hermitian EVD
* Many algorithms for Singular-Value soft-Thresholding (SVT)
* Tall-skinny QR decompositions
* Hermitian matrix functions
* Sign-based Lyapunov/Ricatti/Sylvester solvers

For the sake of objectivity: Elemental is primarily intended to be used from 
C++11, though interfaces to other languages, such as C, Fortran 90, and Python, 
are in various stages of development. ScaLAPACK and PLAPACK routines are 
currently significantly more straightforward to call from C and Fortran.

.. note::
   At this point, the vast majority of Elemental's source code is in header 
   files, so do not be surprised by the sparsity of the ``src/`` folder; please
   also look in ``include/``. There were essentially two reasons for moving as 
   much of Elemental as possible into header files:

   1. In practice, most executables only require a small subset of the library, 
      so avoiding the overhead of compiling the entire library beforehand can be
      significant. On the other hand, if one naively builds many such 
      executables with overlapping functionality, then the mainly-header 
      approach becomes slower. 
   2. Though Elemental does not yet fully support computation over arbitrary 
      fields, the vast majority of its pieces do. Moving templated 
      implementations into header files is a necessary step in the process and 
      also allowed for certain templating techniques to exploited in order to 
      simplify the class hierarchy.

Dependencies
============
* Functioning C++11 and ANSI C compilers.
* A working MPI2 implementation.
* BLAS and LAPACK (ideally version 3.3 or greater) implementations. 
* `CMake <http://www.cmake.org>`_ (version 2.8.8 or later).

If a sufficiently up-to-date C++11 compiler is used (e.g., recent versions of 
``g++`` or ``clang++``), Elemental should be straightforward to build on 
Unix-like platforms. Building on Microsoft Windows platforms should also be 
possible with minor effort.

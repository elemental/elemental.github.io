Control theory
**************

The following rudimentary algorithms draw heavily from the second chapter of 
Nicholas J. Higham's "Functions of Matrices: Theory and Computation" and depend
heavily on the matrix sign function. They have only undergone cursory testing
and primarily exist due to the simplicity of their implementation. Ideally,
there will eventually be high-performance implementations based upon Schur 
decompositions.

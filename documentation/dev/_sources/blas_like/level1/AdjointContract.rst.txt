AdjointContract
===============
Perform :math:`B := \sum_i A_i^H`, where the summation is performed over the 
local data of each member of the process team that was redundantly assigned 
entries of :math:`A` but is not redundantly assigned entries of :math:`B`.
Thus, in the general case where each column and row of :math:`A` is respectively
distributed over the process sets :math:`U_0 \times U_1` and 
:math:`V_0 \times V_1`, while each column and row of :math:`B` is respectively
distributed over :math:`U_0` and :math:`V_0`, then the result is of the form

.. math::

   B = \sum_{i \in U_1 \times V_1} A_i^H.

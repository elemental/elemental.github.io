Introduction

Overview
========
Elemental is a library for distributed-memory dense and sparse-direct linear 
algebra that draws heavily from the 
`PLAPACK <http://cs.utexas.edu/users/plapack>`_ approach of building a graph of
matrix distributions with a simple interface for redistributions 
Elemental is also similar in functionality to 
`ScaLAPACK <http://netlib.org/scalapack>`_, which is the very 
widely used effort towards extending `LAPACK <http://netlib.org/lapack>`_ onto 
distributed-memory architectures.
Unlike PLAPACK and ScaLAPACK, Elemental performs virtually all computations 
using element-wise, rather than block, matrix distributions 
(please see the first journal publication on Elemental, 
*Elemental: A new framework for distributed
memory dense matrix computations*, for a detailed discussion of this design 
choice).
Some of the unique features of Elemental include distributed implementations of:

* High-performance pseudospectral computation and visualization
* Quadratic-time low-rank Cholesky and LU modifications
* Bunch-Kaufman and Bunch-Parlett for accurate symmetric factorization
* LU and Cholesky with full pivoting
* Column-pivoted QR and interpolative/skeleton decompositions
* Quadratically Weighted Dynamic Halley iteration for the polar decomposition
* Spectral Divide and Conquer Schur decomposition and Hermitian EVD
* Many algorithms for Singular-Value soft-Thresholding (SVT)
* Tall-skinny QR decompositions
* Hermitian matrix functions
* Sign-based Lyapunov/Ricatti/Sylvester solvers

For the sake of objectivity: Elemental is primarily intended to be used from 
C++11 or C, though interfaces to other languages, Fortran 90, Python, and R
are in various stages of development. ScaLAPACK and PLAPACK routines are 
currently significantly more straightforward to call from Fortran.

.. note::

   Though Elemental does not yet fully support computation over arbitrary 
   fields, the vast majority of its pieces do. Moving templated 
   implementations into header files is a necessary step in the process and 
   also allowed for certain templating techniques to exploited in order to 
   simplify the class hierarchy.

Dependencies
============
* Functioning C++11 and ANSI C compilers.
* A working MPI2 implementation.
* BLAS and LAPACK (ideally version 3.3 or greater) implementations. 
* `CMake <http://www.cmake.org>`_ (version 2.8.8 or later).

If a sufficiently up-to-date C++11 compiler is used (e.g., recent versions of 
``g++`` or ``clang++``), Elemental should be straightforward to build on 
Unix-like platforms. Building on Microsoft Windows platforms should also be 
possible with minor effort.

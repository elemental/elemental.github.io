High-level linear algebra
*************************

This chapter describes all of the linear algebra operations which are not basic
enough to fall within the BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) framework.
In particular, algorithms which would traditionally have fallen into the 
domain of LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage), such as factorizations and 
matrix decompositions, are placed here.
